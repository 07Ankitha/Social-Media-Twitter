# Overview
Introducing our new Social Media Management System, a powerful tool designed to enhance your online presence without the complexity. Our platform, built using AJAX, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL, offers a familiar yet innovative experience. It is a fully functional project which has a number of features that will allow users to interact just like on other social networking sites.

This project, developed in PHP and MySQL, focuses on tweet-related features. Users can register with unique usernames, follow other users, and interact with tweets by commenting, liking, and retweeting. One standout feature is the ability to share tweets and images, just like on real social media platforms. Overall, it's a client-side website where users can engage with tweets and build connections with others.
